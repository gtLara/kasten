To verify that a subset $U$ of a vector space $V$ is itself a subspace one must check for the following conditions

- *additive identity*: $U$ contains the $0$ element
* *closed under addition*: $u, w$ $\in U$ $\to$ $v + v \in U$
* *closed under scalar multiplication*: $\lambda \in \mathbf{F}$ and $u \in U$  $\to$ $\lambda u \in U$

If the conditions above are met the 8 vector space axioms are automatically met as well.
