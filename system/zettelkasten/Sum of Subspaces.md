For subspaces $U_1, U_2, ..., U_m$ the sum $\sum_1^{m} U_i$ is defined as all the possible sums of elements $u_i$ of $U_i$

$$\sum_1^{m} U_i = \{u_1+ ...+ u_m | u_i \in U_i\}$$

A sum of subspaces is also a subspace. This is verified through [[Verification that a subset is a subspace]], namely that is contains the $0$ vector and is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.

Is is also the smallest subspace containing the summand subspaces.
