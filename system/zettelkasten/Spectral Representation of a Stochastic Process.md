The spectral representation of a stochastic process is given by the Wiener-Khinchin theorem as the Fourier transform of its autocorrelation function. Note that since the autocorrelation function of a real valued process is even its resulting Fourier transform is symmetric and real valued, which is compatible with the fact that this equals the process' spectral square magnitude.

We are limited therefore to the expression of a stochastic processes' spectral squared magnitude, even after assuming ergodicity and stationarity.
