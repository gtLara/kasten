A linear combination $w$ of a list $X$ of vectors $(v_1, v_2, ... , v_n)$ belonging to vector space $V$ over $\mathbf{F}$ is given by

$$w = \lambda_1v_1 + \lambda_2v_2 + ... + \lambda_nv_n$$

Where $\lambda_i \in \mathbf{F}$  

Since the vector space is closed under addition and scalar multiplication $w \in V$
