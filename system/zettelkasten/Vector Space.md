A vector space $V$ is a set equipped with two operations

-  Addition: Sum of elements $u$, $v$ $\in V$ such that $u + v \in V$ (closed under addition)
- Scalar multiplication that assigns $\lambda v \in V$ to each $v$ in $V$ and $\lambda \in \mathbf{F}$, where $\mathbf{F}$ is an arbitrary field (closed under scalar multiplication)

There operations are such that the following properties hold

- *commutativity*:  $u + v = v + u$  $\forall u, v \in V$ 
- *associativity*: (position of parenthesis don't matter)
	  - $(u+v)+w = u+(v+w)$,  $\forall u, v, w \in V$
	  - $(ab)v = a(bv)$,  $\forall a, b, \in \mathbf{F}$
* *additive identity*: there exists $\bar 0 \in V$ such that $u + \bar0 = u$
* *additive inverse*: for every $v\in V$ there exists $w \in V$ such that $v + w = \bar0$
* *multiplicative identity*: $1v = v$
* *distributive properties*:
    - $a(u + v) = au + av$
    - $(a+b)v = av + bv$ 
    - $\forall a, b \in \mathbf{F}$ and $\forall u, u \in V$
