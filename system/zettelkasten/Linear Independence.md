>[!definition]
A list $v_1, v_2, ..., v_m$ of vectors is said to be independent if the only choice of $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, ..., \lambda_m \in \mathbf{F}$ such that $\lambda_1v_1 + \lambda_2v_2 + ... + \lambda_mv_m = 0$ is $\lambda_i = 0 \forall i$

>[!corollary]
If a list $v_1, v_2 ... , v_m$ is linearly independent there is only one way to write each element of $span(v_1, v_2, ..., v_m)$ as a linear combination of $v_1, v_2, ..., v_m$.
