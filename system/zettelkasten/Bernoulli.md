>[!definition]
The r.v. $X$ is said to have a *Bernoulli* distribution with parameter $\theta\in [0, 1]$ if its support set is $X(\omega) = \{0, 1\}$  with $P(X = 1)=\theta$ 

>[!corollary]
$$E(X) = \theta$$ 

This simple distribution is used to represent experiments with binary outcomes where outcomes $0$ and $1$ are referred to failures and successes, respectively.
